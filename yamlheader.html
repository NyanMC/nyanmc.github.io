                            first of all, if you're not from the archipelago server, how did you get here? anyway...<br>
                            if you were linked here, you likely saw a link in chromanyan's yaml, or inquired about the yaml in a way which can be explained here.<br><br>

                            this is the yaml header. this is a header that i type out for most yamls that i make, for the purposes of organization. it lists the multiworld
                            the yaml was initially made for, the games it contains, and any other important information about the yaml, such as the presence of deathlink,
                            energylink, item links, or plando. if there is something in the yaml which could harm the multiworld, it will contain an exclamation point
                            before and after, sometimes multiple (e.g. ! Priority Vault !, !!! WARNING: Coinsanity 1 DLCQuest !!!, !!! WARNING: EXTREME numbers of Bee Traps !!!).

                        <h2>FAQ</h2>
                        <h3>But why?</h3>
                        <p>
                            i collect my yamls and store them in a "mini bucket", and this helps with organization. if i want to dig out a yaml in the future, it helps me recall
                            what all the yaml even contains. if you want to view the contents of my "mini bucket", you can do so <a href="https://github.com/NyanMC/YamlBucket">here</a>,
                            though i don't update it often.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why does every slot end with {NUMBER}?</h3>
                        <p>
                            if i were to want to, say, generate every yaml in the bucket simultaneously, this would allow me to do just that. i sometimes end up needing to do this
                            on a much smaller scale, for instance if i want to use universal tracker for several multiworlds at once (plus, doing all the yamls at once could make
                            for a fun solo async sometime, you never know). if you are the host and this bothers you, you can strip it from the yaml and it will not affect me.
